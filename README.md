# devops-actions/issue-comment-tag
Tag a user or a team in an issue comment

Sometimes you want to tag a team or multiple persons when an issue (or something else) is created. This action will help you do that by tagging them in an issue.
##### Note: only tagging a single person or team is currently supported.


# Usage:

Requirements:

A GitHub App [https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps] installed on the repository/organization that the GitHub Actions Workflow will execute from
The GitHub Apps minimally should have the following permissions:
  - Read & write access to Issues
  - Read-only access to Members
  - Read-only access to Administration (Only applicable for GitHub Enterprise Server)
A method to retrieve `GITHUB_TOKEN` (script/action), a good example for action would be `peter-murray/workflow-application-token-action`

``` yaml
  - uses: devops-actions/issue-comment-tag@v0.1.0
    with:
      team: < insert team or user name >
      issue: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
      owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
      repo: ${{ github.repository }}
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

# Example workflow:
``` yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
    
jobs:
  tag-a-user:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: 
      - uses: devops-actions/issue-comment-tag@v0.1.0
        name: Tag a user or team in an issue comment
        with: 
          issue: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          team: < insert team or user name >
          owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Tagging an internal team or user
If you need to tag an internal team `@<org name>/team` or user, then you need to send in a **Personal Access Token** to do so: the normal `GITHUB_TOKEN` doesn't have access outside the current repository, which also means it cannot see the users in the organization.

If you are using a GitHub App for creating the access token, you need to give the App the following scope:
- Organization permissions - Members: Read only
